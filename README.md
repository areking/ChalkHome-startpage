# ChalkHome-startpage
Startpage with chalkboard theme 

Hi guys, this is my first time ever using html, css and javascript so be nice :D (expecially for the code, cause i like the result viewing, but i'm pretty sure that would be million better ways to do that)
I wanted a new startpage and wanted to learn some html and js so it came out this, that has really a lot of useless stuffs, but it's for learning purpose.
I had fun doing this and i'm happy with the result. Any comment is welcome.

##### Credits:
 - All the styles and the images are from me
 - Lot of js code is from googling what i needed
 - Icons are from the web and i used icomoon to make them a font

##### Features:
- Responsive design with pretty colors
- Quick search through lot of sites (example typing '-r startpage' would make the search in reddit with the word startpage)
	*list of the commands is visible at '-?'.
	**lot of the links are in italian language so you should change them but i made it the easiest cause all the editable stuff is in just one file, so all these links have their own easy array.
- Possibility to chose the settings, colors, fonts, backgrounds (use '-set')
- To-do list that use localStorage to store data even after refreshing or closing the browsers 
    *use '-todo' or click on the clock.
- Random quote appearing when hovering the clock (i really like this :) with a different style each time you do.
- Extra link at the bottom hidden and shown with a click on the background
- Custom background with opacity that make the content visible only when needed
	*custom background here is the view of Napoli, but you can create your own custom picture like a drawing on a chalkboard
	here i did New York too: * [Backgrounds]
 
if you want something just ask and i'll see what i can do.
