## Usage

Most browsers will require you to use extensions to set a custom startpage as your new tab page:

- [New Tab Redirect](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna) for Chrome
- [New Tab Override](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/) for Firefox
- [Custom New Tab Page](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/custom-new-tab-page/) for Opera
- Safari - set this startpage as your homepage in settings

If you want to use this startpage, be sure to personalize the links in `variables.js` to your liking.
All editable data is stored in some arrays, so you can easily change links, quick search commands, colors, bacgrounds and fonts.

## Credits

I wanted a new startpage and wanted to learn some html and js so it came out this, that has really a lot of useless stuffs, but it's for learning purpose.
I had fun doing this and i'm happy with the result. Any comment is welcome.
